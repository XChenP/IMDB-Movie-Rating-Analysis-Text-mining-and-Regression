Before submitting your project, it will be a good idea to go back through your report and remove these sections to make the presentation of your work as tidy as possible. First things first, you might want to double-click this Markdown cell and change the title so that it reflects your dataset and investigation.\n",

    "> **Tip**: In this section of the report, provide a brief introduction to the dataset you've selected for analysis. At the end of this section, describe the questions that you plan on exploring over the course of the report. Try to build your report around the analysis of at least one dependent variable and three independent variables. If you're not sure what questions to ask, then make sure you familiarize yourself with the dataset, its variables and the dataset context for ideas of what to explore.\n",

Before exporting your report, check over it to make sure that the flow of the report is complete. You should probably remove all of the \"Tip\" quotes like this one so that the presentation is as tidy as possible. It's also a good idea to look over the project rubric, found on the project submission page at the end of the lesson.\n",

If it worked correctly, you should get a return code of 0, and you should see the generated .html file in the workspace directory (click on the jupyter icon in the upper left). Alternatively, you can download the html report via the **File** > **Download as** submenu and then manually upload it to the workspace directory. Once you've done this, you can submit your project by clicking on the \"Submit Project\" button in the lower right. Congratulations!"
